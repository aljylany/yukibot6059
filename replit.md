# ü§ñ ÿ®Ÿàÿ™ ŸäŸàŸÉŸä - Yuki Bot

## Overview
Yuki Bot is an intelligent and advanced Telegram bot designed to offer a wide array of features within group chats. Its primary purpose is to enhance user interaction through AI capabilities, games, financial management tools, and interactive systems. The project aims to provide a comprehensive and engaging experience, leveraging cutting-edge AI for content moderation and personalized user interactions.

## User Preferences
- **Communication Style:** The user prefers clear and simple Arabic language for all interactions and explanations.
- **Workflow:** The user desires an iterative development process, with clear demonstrations of new features and functionalities as they are implemented.
- **Interaction:** The user wants the agent to ask for confirmation before making any major architectural changes or significant code refactoring.
- **Feature Prioritization:** The user prioritizes the development of robust content moderation systems and engaging interactive AI features.

## System Architecture

The Yuki Bot is built with a modular and extensible architecture, emphasizing smart content moderation and dynamic user interaction.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Language:** Fully supports Arabic with optimized messages and responses for an Arabic-speaking audience.
- **Interactive Menus:** Utilizes numbered smart menus and direct commands for intuitive user navigation and feature access.

### Technical Implementations
- **AI & Interaction:**
    - **Smart Menus:** Features a "Smart Menu" with 8 interactive options (e.g., economic analysis, smart games, quizzes, interactive stories, AI battles).
    - **FSM (Finite State Machine):** Employs FSM states (`SmartCommandStates`) to manage complex multi-step interactions like quizzes and interactive narratives.
    - **API Management:** Reads all API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Telegram Bot Token, YouTube) from a single `api.txt` file for easy configuration and security.
    - **Comprehensive AI System:** Uses Google AI (Gemini) for intelligent responses and user interactions.
- **Command Handling:**
    - **Direct Commands:** Supports direct Arabic and English commands for quick access to features.
    - **Basic Permission System:** Implements a permission system for basic administrative functions.
    - **Economic Systems:** Full-featured banking, real estate, investment, and theft mechanics.
    - **Gaming Systems:** XP/leveling, farm management, castle building, and competitive features.

### Feature Specifications
- **Economic Systems:** Complete banking system with deposits, withdrawals, transfers, loans, and interest calculations.
- **Real Estate:** Property buying, selling, and management system with market dynamics.
- **Investment Portfolio:** Stock trading, investment tracking, and portfolio management.
- **Gaming Features:** XP progression, leveling system, farm management, castle building, and theft mechanics.
- **AI Integration:** Smart conversational AI using Google Gemini for natural language interactions.
- **Smart Menus:** Interactive menu system for complex operations and feature discovery.

### System Design Choices
- **Modularity:** Core functionalities are organized into distinct modules (e.g., `banks.py`, `real_estate.py`, `smart_menu_handler.py`, `comprehensive_ai_system.py`).
- **Clean Architecture:** Streamlined codebase focused on core gaming and economic features without unnecessary complexity.
- **Performance Optimization:** Efficient processing with intelligent API key management and automatic switching.
- **Simplified Dependencies:** Reduced complexity by removing non-essential systems and focusing on core functionality.
