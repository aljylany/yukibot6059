# Overview

This project is an advanced Arabic-language Telegram economic simulation bot named "يوكي" (Yuki) with enhanced interactive features. The bot includes a comprehensive virtual economy with banking, real estate, stock trading, farming, and player-vs-player systems. Recent enhancements focus on bot personality protection, custom command systems for authorized users, music search functionality, and automated responses to specific triggers. The architecture remains modular with new security and entertainment systems integrated.

# System Architecture

## Framework and Technology Stack
- **Bot Framework**: `aiogram` (Python async Telegram bot framework)
- **Database**: SQLite with `aiosqlite` for async operations
- **Programming Language**: Python with async/await patterns

## Core Architectural Decisions
- **Modular Design**: Features are separated into distinct modules for clear separation of concerns.
- **Command-Based Interface**: All user interactions are driven by text commands.
- **Group-Exclusive Operation**: The bot functions primarily within Telegram groups; private messages guide users to group setup.
- **State Management**: `aiogram`'s Finite State Machine (FSM) manages complex multi-step user interactions.
- **Database Layer**: Asynchronous database operations using `aiosqlite` ensure efficient CRUD functionality.
- **Admin & Access Control**: A multi-level admin privilege system with decorator-based access control and comprehensive moderation tools.
- **Hierarchical Administrative System**: Implemented a 4-level administrative hierarchy (Masters, Group Owners, Moderators, Members) with dynamic permission system.
- **Arabic Language Support**: Designed for native Arabic language interaction.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: The interface is text-command driven, focusing on clear, concise Arabic messages. Visual elements are text-based charts (ASCII art).
- **Insulting Permission System**: A hierarchical system that provides different insulting responses based on user level and the unauthorized command attempted.
