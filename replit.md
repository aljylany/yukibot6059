# ðŸ¤– Ø¨ÙˆØª ÙŠÙˆÙƒÙŠ - Yuki Bot

## Overview
Yuki Bot is an intelligent and advanced Telegram bot designed to offer a wide array of features within group chats. Its primary purpose is to enhance user interaction through AI capabilities, games, financial management tools, and interactive systems. The project aims to provide a comprehensive and engaging experience, leveraging cutting-edge AI for content moderation and personalized user interactions.

## User Preferences
- **Communication Style:** The user prefers clear and simple Arabic language for all interactions and explanations.
- **Workflow:** The user desires an iterative development process, with clear demonstrations of new features and functionalities as they are implemented.
- **Interaction:** The user wants the agent to ask for confirmation before making any major architectural changes or significant code refactoring.
- **Feature Prioritization:** The user prioritizes the development of robust content moderation systems and engaging interactive AI features.

## System Architecture

The Yuki Bot is built with a modular and extensible architecture, emphasizing smart content moderation and dynamic user interaction.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Language:** Fully supports Arabic with optimized messages and responses for an Arabic-speaking audience.
- **Interactive Menus:** Utilizes numbered smart menus and direct commands for intuitive user navigation and feature access.

### Technical Implementations
- **Content Moderation:**
    - **Comprehensive Content Filter:** Integrates profanity detection with explicit content filtering (images, videos, stickers, files) using Google AI (Gemini) for advanced analysis.
    - **Graduated Penalties:** Implements a tiered punishment system ranging from warnings to permanent bans based on content severity.
    - **Admin Reporting System:** Provides real-time notifications, daily summaries, and detailed reports for administrators on detected violations.
    - **Testing & Monitoring:** Includes extensive test commands (`/test_filter`, `/test_profanity`, `Ø§Ø®ØªØ¨Ø§Ø± Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø¸Ø§Ù…`) and detailed logging for live monitoring of filtering processes.
- **AI & Interaction:**
    - **Smart Menus:** Features a "Smart Menu" with 8 interactive options (e.g., economic analysis, smart games, quizzes, interactive stories, AI battles).
    - **FSM (Finite State Machine):** Employs FSM states (`SmartCommandStates`) to manage complex multi-step interactions like quizzes and interactive narratives.
    - **API Management:** Reads all API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Telegram Bot Token, YouTube) from a single `api.txt` file for easy configuration and security.
- **Command Handling:**
    - **Direct Commands:** Supports direct Arabic and English commands for quick access to features.
    - **Permission System:** Implements a robust permission system: Owners and "Masters" have full access, Moderators have access to reports/stats, and regular members have no administrative access. "Masters" are immune to penalties.

### Feature Specifications
- **Content Types Scanned:** Text, images, videos (frame extraction + filename), stickers (emoji + filename + image analysis), and files (type + filename + image content).
- **Punishment Levels:** Warning, 5-30 min mute, 1-6 hour mute, 24-hour to permanent mute, permanent group ban.
- **Admin Commands:** Includes commands for security statistics (`Ø§Ø­ØµØ§Ø¦ÙŠØ§Øª Ø§Ù„Ø£Ù…Ø§Ù†`), group/user reports (`ØªÙ‚Ø±ÙŠØ± Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ù…ÙˆØ¹Ø©`), system status (`Ø­Ø§Ù„Ø© Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø¸Ø§Ù…`), report subscription management, and user violation log management.

### System Design Choices
- **Modularity:** Core functionalities are organized into distinct modules (e.g., `comprehensive_content_filter.py`, `admin_reports_system.py`, `smart_menu_handler.py`).
- **Redundancy & Fallback:** Old moderation systems are maintained as backups to the new comprehensive system to ensure continuous operation.
- **Performance Optimization:** Focuses on faster and more accurate processing with intelligent API key consumption and automatic switching.
- **Circular Import Resolution:** Specific attention paid to resolving common Python issues like circular imports (e.g., in `utils/decorators.py`).

## External Dependencies
- **Telegram Bot API:** For core bot functionality and interaction.
- **Google AI (Gemini):** Used for advanced AI-driven content analysis, especially for explicit content detection in images and videos.
- **OpenAI API:** For general AI capabilities and intelligent responses.
- **Anthropic API:** For additional AI model integration.
- **YouTube API:** For potential video-related functionalities (e.g., fetching video information).
